This section contains some useful resources for learning about Ledger and embedded developmentâ€”which is especially nuanced and requires additional considerations beyond typical crypto development.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but aims to provide some key materials.

## The Ledger Docs

The Ledger Docs are by far the best place to start.

They cover anything from how a Ledger works, to publishing a Ledger Application, to secure app development.

***Be sure to read the Ledger Security Guidelines.**

It covers many concerns that would typically not be obvious, and is something that should be read more than once.
